Generate 10 English sentences each for the relations: 
grandmother, grandfather, uncle, aunt, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, cousin, nephew, niece. 
For each relation, generate 10 sentences using the following topics: games, deep talks, questions, exclamations, and other forms of speeches. 
Ensure the sentences are varied and include different forms of possessive pronouns (e.g., my, their, his, her). 
Provide the output as a Python list of strings.
